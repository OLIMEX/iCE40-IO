# iCE40-IO

Extension module for iCE40HX1K-EVB or iCE40HX8K-EVB.

It is meant to make the input and output easier - the module provides video output connector VGA DE-15; 
keyboard connector PS2; infra red chip TFDU4100 for IrDA connectivity.

Typically, you would need only a signle iCE40-IO module in your setup. Using an iCE40-IO would reduce
the number of ADC and DAC expansion modules that you can use with a single iCE40HX1K-EVB or iCE40HX8K-EVB board.
